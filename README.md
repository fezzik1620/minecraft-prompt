# minecraft-prompt
Use electron to present a prompt to the user before launching minecraft.
This launcher was created to work with a solution I found online (on a dodgy site that I won't link here) for allowing one Minecraft account to be shared on a home network.

> npm install

Right-click on the Launch Minecraft shortcut and click Properties. Change the "Start in" property to be the folder where you have the project checked out.
